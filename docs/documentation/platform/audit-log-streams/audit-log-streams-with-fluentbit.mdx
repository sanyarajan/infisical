<Info>
    Audit log streams is a paid feature.
   
    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
    then you should contact team@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.

This guide explains how to store Infisical Audit log streams using a provider that doesn't support HTTP-based streaming, such as AWS S3. We'll use a log collector service to achieve this.

## Overview

Log collectors are tools used to collect, analyze, transform, and send logs to storage. In this guide, we'll focus on [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io), a popular and efficient log collector.

You can deploy Fluent Bit in two ways:
1. As a sidecar to your self-hosted Infisical instance
2. As a standalone service in any deployment service (e.g., AWS EC2, ECS, or GCP Compute Engine)

For various deployment options, refer to the [Fluent Bit Getting Started guide](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/getting-started-with-fluent-bit).

## Configuration

To set up Fluent Bit, you'll need to provide a configuration file that establishes an HTTP listener and configures an output to send JSON data to your chosen storage solution (e.g., S3, Elasticsearch).

### Example Configuration: HTTP to AWS S3

The following Fluent Bit configuration sets up an HTTP listener on port `8888` and sends logs to AWS S3:

```ini
[SERVICE]
    Flush        1
    Log_Level    info
    Daemon       off

[INPUT]
    Name   http
    Listen 0.0.0.0
    Port   8888

[OUTPUT]
    Name                         s3
    Match                        *
    bucket                       my-bucket
    region                       us-west-2
    total_file_size              50M
    use_put_object               Off
    compression                  gzip
    s3_key_format                /$TAG/%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S.gz
```
### Connecting Infisical Audit Log Stream

Once you have set up and configured Fluent Bit, you can direct the Infisical Audit log stream to the Fluent Bit HTTP listener address.


By following this guide, you can effectively store Infisical Audit log streams in AWS S3 or other storage solutions that don't natively support HTTP-based streaming. 

This approach provides flexibility and allows you to leverage the power of log collectors like Fluent Bit to manage and store your audit logs efficiently.
